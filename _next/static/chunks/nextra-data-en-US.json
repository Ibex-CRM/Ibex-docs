These sections contain extensive information and allow users to search for specific benchmarks.For easier access, one default organic view has been created showcasing the most frequently used benchmarks with simplified filtering options.","visualizations#Visualizations:":"Each page contains various visualizations (charts, graphs, tables) that present data in different ways. Hovering your mouse over data points in the visualizations reveals more detailed information. Within each visualization you can also enter into Focus Mode available at the top right corner of each visual.","slicers#Slicers:":"The white boxes at the top of each page are slicers. They act as filters for the data. Selecting a value in a slicer (e.g., \"United Kingdom\" in the Location slicer) will filter all visualizations on the current page to show only data related to that selection.\nYou can select multiple values in slicers by holding down Ctrl/Cmd while clicking.\nClearing a slicer selection with the eraser icon at the top will remove the selections on that slicer.","interactivity#Interactivity:":"The report is interactive meaning that clicking on elements within a visualization (e.g., a bar in a bar chart) will filter other visualizations on the page, highlighting related data. This is called cross-filtering.","benchmarks-analyzed#Benchmarks Analyzed:":"The top right corner of each page displays a summary statistics displaying how many benchmarks are in use to generate the specific data you're looking at.","tooltips#Tooltips:":"Hover over each visual to reveal multiple tooltips.
