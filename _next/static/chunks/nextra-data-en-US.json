This allows us to create custom components that are specific to our documentation.At the same time we are still writing in Markdown which allows us to migrate everything to Notion\neasily, albeit with some loss of functionality.Also, everything is save in a github repository, so we can easily make changes\nand collaborate on the documentation."}}}
