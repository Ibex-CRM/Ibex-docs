### Performance Analyser

## Introduction

Gain campaign insights for a campaign or brand across organic and paid.

Initially intended as a PCA data visualisation tool. While this is absolutly what it can be used for its capabilities go far beyond just that. 

The Performance Analyser is a tool designed to handle and analyze sensitive data, including information about influencers Cost Per Mille (CPMs), Cost Per Action (CPAs), engagement rates, etc. This data is primarily for internal use, with an automatic 0% margin setting.

It's important to be mindful of what information is shared with clients, especially in an undisclosed model where all data is based on internal costings without the correct margin applied.

The default view displays campaign codes from the past six months at a 0% margin. Users can filter this data by different brands and campaigns, such as the Mars Snickers' summer campaign. The application then pulls through all the influencers that the brand has engaged with over the selected time frame, providing insights on CPMs against engagement rate, impressions, and other metrics.

The application allows users to adjust the time frame beyond six months and filter data by platform and post types. It also enables comparison of different post types, like TikTok posts against Instagram reels, providing a comprehensive understanding of campaign performance.

Additionally ther is the option to create custom graphs, enabling users to compare different metrics like CPA against the engagement rate. This feature makes it easier to pull data into a PCA.

The Performance Analyser application is highly customizable. If there are any graphs or data points not currently accessible but needed, users can reach out to have those added, provided the data is in the system.

The Performance Analyser is client-focused, while the benchmark analysis provides industry-wide data over time. Using both together can provide powerful insights into how a brand is performing against industry standards. In the future, there are plans to create a client portal where clients can log in and access their data, excluding some costing data. This feature will be particularly beneficial for long-term clients.
