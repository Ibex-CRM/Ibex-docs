# .github / workflows

In this folder we keep the github workflow files that trigger the background jobs carried by github actions.
The workflows are triggered by events such as pull requests, pushes, etc.

A few things to note:
  - When pushing to a branch a new workflow or a modification of a workflow, the workflow that you are pushing will be the one triggered (if conditions met). If there are other workflows in the project those will be triggered too if the conditions stipulated are met.
  - When writing a workflow the indentation is crucial as the github needs it to understand the structure of the workflow.
  - The workflows are defined in yaml files.

```yaml
name: Create Pull Request

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - figma-tokens

jobs:
  pull-request:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: create pull request
        uses: repo-sync/pull-request@v2
        with:
          destination_branch: 'master'
          pr_title: 'Update tokens'
          pr_body: 'This is an automated pull request to update from branch figma-tokens'
          pr_label: 'automerge'
          github_token: ${{ secrets.FIGMA_PAT }}


```

In this example workflow:
  - _**name**_: this is the name of the workflow, it is used to identify the workflow in the github actions tab and to
    reference it if we need to trigger other actions connected to it.
  - _**on**_: this is the event that triggers the workflow. In this case the workflow is triggered when a push is made to the branch figma-tokens.
  - _**jobs**_: this is the list of jobs that are executed when the workflow is triggered. In this case we have only one job called pull-request.
    But we could have more jobs in the same workflow or name it differently.
  - _**steps**_: this is the list of steps that are executed when the workflow is triggered. In this case we have to, checkout and create a pull request.
    Note that the last step has a _**with**_ property that contains the parameters that are passed to the action.

This is just a quick guide an explanation, for more on github actions and workflows check out the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/introduction-to-github-actions).

## Cabra workflows
  - ### wf1-figma-tokens-push
    - This is the first job that runs when anything is pushed to the figma-tokens branch.
    - It creates a pull request and adds a label to it. The label is needed for one of the next jobs to run.
    - The pull request requires a github personal access token (PAT) to be able to create the pull request.
      The PAT is stored in the github repo secrets. The PAT is used to authenticate the user that creates the pull request.
      At the moment all the pull request are created in my name (Carlos) but this can be changed in the future.
  - ### wf2-figma-tokens-pr
    - This is the second job that runs after a pull request is created.(I know, naming could be better)
    - This job checks that the pull request is created in the figma-tokens branch.
    - Then it runs the _**token-transformer**_ to make the tokens readable by _**style-dictionary**_.
    - Then it runs the _**style-dictionary**_ to generate the tokens in the format that we will use.
    - Lastly it commits the changes to the figma-tokens branch.
  - ### wf3-auto-merge
    - This jobs runs only after **wf2** is completed successfully.
    - Then it checks that the pull request has the label _**automerge**_.
    - Then it merges the pull request to master.
  - ### wf4-deploy-docs
    - This job runs after **wf3** is completed successfully.
    - Then it builds the static site, exports it (to **/out**), adds a file (**.nojekyll**) to the root of the site and pushes it to the gh-pages branch.
      Which is the branch that github uses to host the static site.
