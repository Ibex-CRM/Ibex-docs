# NPM/index

This file is the point of entry of our NPM package when in use. It is the file that is executed when you import Cabra in your React app.
It is a simple file that imports all the `Cabra` components and exports them.

```js
var _interopRequireDefault = require("@babel/runtime/helpers/interopRequireDefault");

// Global Components

var _TagPill2 = _interopRequireDefault(require('cabra/components/TagPill'));
exports.TagPill = _TagPill2.default;

// Roster Components

var _rosterCard2 = _interopRequireDefault(require('cabra/components/roster/card'));
exports.rosterCard = _rosterCard2.default;
```

As you can see it requires a helper from @babel to work. Follow this pattern closely and it has proven to be reliable. And add a comment for each component family you create.
