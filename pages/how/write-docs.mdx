# Writing documentation


### Why writing documentation is important:
Documentation effectively connects humans and machines.

- For you:
  - You will be using your code in 6 months
  - You want people to use your code and give you credit
  - Others would be encouraged to contribute to your code
  <br/>
- For others:
  - Others can easily use your code and build upon it
  <br/>

What should you document about your code? Everything! All the data, notes, code, and materials someone else would need to reproduce your work.

#### Best Practices for Writing Documentation:

1. Include a README file that contains
    - A brief description of the project
    - Installation instructions
    - A short example/tutorial
2. Allow issue tracker for others
3. Write an API documentation
    - What a function does
    - What are the function's parameters or arguments are
    - What a function returns
4. Document your code
5. Apply coding conventions, such as file organization, comments, naming conventions, programming practices, etc.
6. Include information for contributors
7. Include licensing information
8. List all the versions of the files along with the major edits you did in each version
