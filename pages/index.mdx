## Why use Nextra?

The main reason to use [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) for the Ibex User documentation instead of tools
like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), which we use for other purposes, is the support of [React](https://reactjs.org/)
components inside our Markdown files. This allows us to create custom components that are specific to our documentation.

At the same time we are still writing in Markdown which allows us to migrate everything to [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
easily, albeit with some loss of functionality.

Also, everything is save in a [github](https://github.com/Ibex-CRM/ibex-user-docs) repository, so we can easily make changes
and collaborate on the documentation.
